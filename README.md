# 🌟 CI/CD Pipeline for Spring Boot Project using Jenkins 🌟

This project demonstrates a simple **CI/CD pipeline** built with **Jenkins** to automate the build, test, and deployment process of a Spring Boot application. 🚀 The pipeline ensures seamless integration and delivery, helping developers ship high-quality code efficiently. 💻✨

---

## 🎯 Features
- 🛠️ Automated build and test process for every code change.
- ✅ Continuous integration with GitHub (or any Git-based repository).
- 📦 Build Spring Boot artifacts (e.g., `.jar` or `.war`).
- 🚀 Deployment to a staging or production server.
- 🔄 Feedback loop with build status notifications.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
To set up this pipeline, you’ll need the following:
- 🐙 A **GitHub** repository with your Spring Boot project.
- 🤖 **Jenkins** installed and running (with access to your repo).
- ☕ **Java 11+** installed on the Jenkins server.
- 🐳 (Optional) **Docker** for containerized deployment.

## 📝 Jenkinsfile Overview

The `Jenkinsfile` defines the pipeline stages:  

1. **Checkout Code**: Pull the latest code from the Git repository. 🐙  
2. **Build**: Compile the code and build the Spring Boot project using Maven. ⚙️  
3. **Test**: Run unit tests to ensure code quality. 🧪  
4. **Package**: Package the application into a `.jar` file. 📦  
5. **Deploy**: Deploy the `.jar` file to the staging or production environment. 🚀  

---

## 🚀 Setting Up the Pipeline

1. **Clone your Spring Boot project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spring-boot-jenkins-pipeline.git
   cd spring-boot-jenkins-pipeline
   ```

2. **Create a Jenkins job**:
   - Login to Jenkins and create a new pipeline job.
   - Link your GitHub repository to the Jenkins job.
   - Add the `Jenkinsfile` to the repository root.

3. **Configure Jenkins plugins**:
   Ensure the following plugins are installed:
   - 🛠️ **Pipeline**  
   - ☕ **Maven Integration**  
   - 🔄 **GitHub Integration**  

4. **Run the pipeline**:
   - Trigger the pipeline manually or enable webhooks for automatic builds.
   - Monitor the pipeline stages in the Jenkins dashboard. 📊

## 📜 Sample Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools {
        maven 'Maven_3.8.5' // Specify your Maven version
        jdk 'Java_11'       // Specify your JDK version
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://github.com/yourusername/spring-boot-jenkins-pipeline.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean compile'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Package') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'scp target/*.jar user@server:/deploy/path/'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
